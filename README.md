# 🐚 DevOps Bash Scripting Module

Welcome to the **DevOps-learning-BASH-module**!  
This repository documents my Bash scripting journey as part of my broader DevOps upskilling roadmap.

## 📚 Overview

This repo contains structured Bash scripting exercises and assignments ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The tasks are designed to build practical command-line automation skills that are essential for a DevOps role.

The structure includes:

- ✅ Hands-on scripting tasks
- ✅ Battle-themed challenge scripts
- ✅ Organized learning notes
- ✅ Real-world automation scenarios (e.g., backups, monitoring, parsing config files)

## 🏆 Bash Battle Arena (Challenges)

Each file in the `Bash-battle-arena` folder represents a progressive scripting challenge. These range from simple variable usage to more complex automation problems. Some highlights include:

- `Level-1-the-basics.sh` — Echo, variables, and basic flow  
- `Level-5-the-boss Battle-combining-basics.sh` — Combining loops, conditionals, and input  
- `Level-9-script-to-monitor-directory-changes.sh` — Basic real-time file monitoring  
- `Level-13-backup-script-with-rotation.sh` — Backup logic with rotation  
- `Level-15-boss-battle-3-advanced-scripting.sh` — Capstone challenge combining multiple skills

## 🧠 Why Bash?

Bash is the backbone of automation in Linux/Unix systems. Mastery of Bash:

- Helps build reliable scripts for everyday system tasks  
- Enhances your DevOps toolkit (scripting in pipelines, provisioning, etc.)  
- Builds a solid foundation before jumping into more advanced tools
